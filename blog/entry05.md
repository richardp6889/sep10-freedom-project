## Aframe
#### In a nutshell Aframe is a tool that uses its own html elements that make shapes in 3d similar to basic vr and with unqiue tags that can be added it can change how different one shapes looks to another of the same shape but with different attributes.

We spend a couple weeks researching how the tool works and if we find the tool interesting enough to learn it. The color, size location, and what it is can be changed and can be used to pretty much manke anything. During this time I learned how the placement of these shapes works with changes in the x,y,z. The x makes it move to the right when changed with positive number and left with negatvie number. The y goes up with positive numbers and down with negative and the z goes forward with positve numbers and back with negative numbers.

As I was starting by learning.
