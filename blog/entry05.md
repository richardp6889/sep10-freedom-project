## Aframe
#### In a nutshell Aframe is a tool that uses its own html elements that make shapes in 3d similar to basic vr and with unqiue tags that can be added it can change how different one shapes looks to another of the same shape but with different attributes.

We spend a couple weeks researching how the tool works and if we find the tool interesting enough to learn it. The color, size location, and what it is can be changed and can be used to pretty much manke anything. During this time I learned how the placement of these shapes works with changes in the x,y,z. The x makes it move to the right when changed with positive number and left with negatvie number. The y goes up with positive numbers and down with negative and the z goes forward with positve numbers and back with negative numbers.

As I was starting by learning the tool the first few things I did was go to the [Aframe website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/introduction/best-practices.html#a-frame) to get a rundown of how it works and a few examples that i could copy paste into a file to see how it worked and studied what each thing did. I then tweaked the existing attributes to change what it looked like. The easiest change I made was the color since it was a simple matter of changing the name of hex code. The next thing i changed and took a longer time was the positioning since it was something that was a bit complicated since the shape took up a certain spot. After this I decided to learn how to change the scale of a shape by streching it by their x,y,z axises I then had to review positioning since if you scale up the y you might need to move things around to fit on it.

After learning the basics I made a new file free of copy pastes and started simply by adding shapes and changing their colors this was done for a few day to actually get familiar. I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+positioning+works+in+aframe+html) to understand it as well. It was at this point to that I realised that i should have made a new file for each thing I tried since what I ended up doing for a while was using the same file to test different things out. From what I remember the things I tried was stacking the same shapes on top of each other, changing the scale of the shapes by a lot and steching shapes.

### Skills
#### Problem decompositon/How to learn:
I learned that to learn a new tool from scratch was breaking it down by what makes a shape look a certain way because if you jump head first trying to do this you will end up confused on why something isn't working or you don' know how to change certain features of the desired shap.
