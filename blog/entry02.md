### Agriculture Apps Today 
There are a few apps that allow for precise knowledge of the outcome and process of growing plants such as [Farmbrite](https://www.farmbrite.com/#:~:text=Our%20farm%20manager%20software%20helps,simplify%20ROI%20and%20compliance%20reporting) that give you the information on how to plant said plants into rows and columns and the depth of the hole. It also gives insight on how much you can expect the plant to grow and how much you'd get out of the yield. [Ruumi](https://www.ruumi.io/faqs-for-farmers#:~:text=To%20enable%20farmers%20to%20restore,improvements%20you%20make%20over%20time) is another app that can help with the process of less intensive farming since it can find a problem with the soil and solve it if needed via machine learning. The components needed to maximize the effectiveness of the apps are a machine like the [seed placer](https://www.farmmanagement.pro/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/planting-equipment-620x330.jpg) helps put those seedlings the depth its needs. The tool used before another harvest is a [harrow](https://images.rawpixel.com/image_800/cHJpdmF0ZS9sci9pbWFnZXMvd2Vic2l0ZS8yMDIyLTA0L2pvYjY3My0wNTgtdi5qcGc.jpg) that works in a similar way to a broom that drags the leftover mess out the fields. Another machine that assists on the process of clearing the field is the [soil cultivator](https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Blog/be/e3/bee3c306-a76c-421c-9053-7b4def2c0694.jpg) that crushes upper soil layers making them softer for the new crops.  

### EDP 
The next step would be to see what is being done and if there is actual technology being developed today that is going to change to automated or if there are companies already switching to automated farming even if they are smaller companies. There are a few unnamed companies that claim they are using robots to farm and I can't quite tell you but it is an official company that focuses on robots. This seems to be gaining in popularity since it is more accurate, efficient, and cost effective. 

### Skills 
Organization would probably be the most important part since to get all the information accurately and organize the different hardware and software. It also improves the understanding of the topic since it is each with the group that fits it instead of being all over the place and trying to make sense of it like I did previously.  
How to Read would also be one since most of the machines used for farming are repetitive and perform the same functions and therefore picking the most used and effective one at its job was also hard since the farming industry doesn't put out all their details for the people to know or read about. Along with this I learned that the same machine can serve a different function such as the seed plants when tweaked a little can take the plant out.
