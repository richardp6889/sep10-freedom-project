### Ariculutre Apps Today 
There are a few apps that allow for precise knowledge of the outcome and process of growing plants such as [Farmbrite](https://www.farmbrite.com/#:~:text=Our%20farm%20manager%20software%20helps,simplify%20ROI%20and%20compliance%20reporting) that give you the information on how to plant said plants into rows and colunms and the depth of the hole. It also gives insight on how much you can expect the plant to grow and how much youÂ´d get out of the yield. [Ruumi](https://www.ruumi.io/faqs-for-farmers#:~:text=To%20enable%20farmers%20to%20restore,improvements%20you%20make%20over%20time) is another app that can help with the process of less intensive farming since it can find a problem with the soil and solve it if needed via machine learning. The compoments needed to maximize the effectiveness of the apps are a machind like the [seed placer](https://www.farmmanagement.pro/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/planting-equipment-620x330.jpg) helps put those seedlings the depth its needs. The tool used before another harvest is a [harrow](https://images.rawpixel.com/image_800/cHJpdmF0ZS9sci9pbWFnZXMvd2Vic2l0ZS8yMDIyLTA0L2pvYjY3My0wNTgtdi5qcGc.jpg) that works in a similar way to a broom that drags the leftover mess out the fields. Another machine that assists on the process of clearing the field is the [soil cultivator](https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Blog/be/e3/bee3c306-a76c-421c-9053-7b4def2c0694.jpg) that crushes upper soil layers making them softer for the new crops.
