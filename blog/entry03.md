## Content
Ideas that I have come up with was that there would be a drone that moves by itself and checks for anything that might concern the plant weather it might be climate, soil moisture, or even plague/ disease. The idea behind it was that it would not have the difficulties of being in the land and facing the terrain there and instead it could take care of itself since it could charge itself with solar energy since it would make it sustainable so it can do it by autonomous.
Another idea that I came up with that changes directions from the previous one was that you have a light-weight road roller that checks for conditions that are demanded from the plant when farming such as but not limited to moisture, leftover debris, soil condition, temperature, etc.
A machine to check the stress levels of the plant would be paired with the rollers as stress could ruin expected yield.
## EDP
The third step is to think of ideas and all the ideas I came up with were thought of and not copied from some other source. These ideas and designs were thought on how efficient they are at doing their intended purpose. These were also taken into account that they are like a computer telling output to the person making the job easier or telling another supercomputer on how to approach the results.
## Skills
Finding a way to break down the struggles that make farming a labor focused made the brainstorming much easier since it would try to automate it but make it compatible with people as well. The major problem is surrounded with solutions for other problems that might arise from the main focus.
An original idea that was scrapped was a big machine that was too closely in the aspects of a tractor and if the machine to make it autonomous was similar looking and acting as current technology then it would not be technology of the future but rather a tiny improvement to an already capable machine
