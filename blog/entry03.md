## Content 
Ideas that I have come up with was that there would be a drone that moves by itself and checks for anything that might concern the plant weather it might is climate, soil moisture, or even plague/ disease. The idea behind it was that it would not have the difficulties of being in the land and facing the terrain there and instead it could take care of itself since it could charge itself with solar energy since it would make it sustainable so it can do it by autonomous.
