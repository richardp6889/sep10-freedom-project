### Agriculture MVP
The basis of my website was to make a website describing and giving a possible solution to take away the labor intensive task that is farming since it takes a lot of effort to make the food we eat today. So when designing the MVP of the website was made by adding the tools that are used today to used present day that facilitate the process a little bit without having to take a gamble and guess which is an improvement to how it was before. However there is still much labor that it has to go through, so I presented my idea at the bottom. The css added was to emphasize the accents of nature with greens and the image to present a piece of farmland. The format for a mobile phone was made with scrolling in mind since it would be more comfortable to scroll a bit rather than a lot and therefore the information was grouped so it can be presented together rather than a fragments here and there. So when brought into a bigger screen the format changes to give more breathing room since there are spaces so it isn't as compacted when scrolling which is easier on a laptop than on a phone.

### Challenges & Takeaways
Something that was difficult to accomplish was the format to switch from how it was on a small screen to a bigger one without too much compromise. In the end it worked out with minimum visibility for change how I wanted it to look to how it actually looked. The solution was to make the margin auto on each side which centers it on every screen and the fix to making it seem centered on smaller screen rather than to the left I increase the image size to fit the screen.

Another challenge was having the motivation to finsih the MVP since having the basic information the website needed was easy and the Aframe embedding was difficult and didn't work so I swapped it out and that was when I didn't feel like continuing since I made it an image that led to the idea and it was okay since it did the job so I continued. The next part as mentioned before was having the layout as I wanted since I decided to put it off until I didn't and it was difficult since the image that led to the Aframe was way to big to fit from the big screen to the small one and it doesn't shrink.

### EDP
The first step to making the MVP was to establish a design for it and make a wireframe for how it would look


### Skills
#### Embracing Failure
This was a very common skill was used since making the website look like intended
