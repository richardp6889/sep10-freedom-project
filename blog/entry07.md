Showing my [project](https://richardp6889.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/)First time giving my elavator pitch was directly to the judges and although having practiced it was a little nerve-wracking having to condense and stretch other parts that the judges asked and becasue of this caught me off-guard. Responding was easy enough since they didn't ask anything too far from what I'd expect. Then after getting the judged pitch it was a little calming giving it to others that came and asked. The first person that came sat down to listen took notes then asked questions like how I got the Aframe moving and how exactly the idea was meant to make the farming process less human intensive, responding with the machine would use the intelligence of the farmer to move it. Then a group of people came asking and praising the aframe asking a similar question to when I was giving the presentation in class. That being what the most frustrating part was and how long it took me. It took me about three weeks and as stated previously the hardest part was having the aframe centered.

In class [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1viZj88XDUAF1XYDbC5ChYVQ6-134bgUrqt_BYZt2c0o/edit#slide=id.p). Giving a presentation in class as opposed to the expo was that all eyes were on you and there was no sound or talking that cut out or gave the room a little less silence. Overall giving the presentation was easily the most simple thing there. The harder parts were explaining what each slide was meant to represent fully since I probably left a few details out since I know it but other that didn't since they didn't choose Aframe. Maintaining eye contact was also hard since
