Showing my [project](https://richardp6889.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/)First time giving my [elavator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zaxr3ogPaHueXDmrx4lWxrQ2BgMv1jH6odsFRqtmP-s/edit) was directly to the judges and although having practiced it was a little nerve-wracking having to condense and stretch other parts that the judges asked and becasue of this caught me off-guard. Responding was easy enough since they didn't ask anything too far from what I'd expect. Then after getting the judged pitch it was a little calming giving it to others that came and asked. The first person that came sat down to listen took notes then asked questions like how I got the Aframe moving and how exactly the idea was meant to make the farming process less human intensive, responding with the machine would use the intelligence of the farmer to move it. Then a group of people came asking and praising the aframe asking a similar question to when I was giving the presentation in class. That being what the most frustrating part was and how long it took me. It took me about three weeks and as stated previously the hardest part was having the aframe centered.

In class [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1viZj88XDUAF1XYDbC5ChYVQ6-134bgUrqt_BYZt2c0o/edit#slide=id.p). Giving a presentation in class as opposed to the expo was that all eyes were on you and there was no sound or talking that cut out or gave the room a little less silence. Overall giving the presentation was easily the most simple thing there. The harder parts were explaining what each slide was meant to represent fully since I probably left a few details out since I know it but other that didn't since they didn't choose Aframe. Maintaining eye contact was also hard since there are many more people at it is slightly uncomfortable having all eyes on you.

### EDP
Starting off on the elavator pitch was having an idea on what someone might have in relation with farming and catching their attention by starting off with a potential question/statement they might have. How better to catch someones attention than with having something they are holding or are near and making a connection to having it be there only because of a interconnected chain starting from crops. Then to finish and polish the pitch was to focus on what the thing that stands out the most when presenting the website preview. The elevator pitch ended up being an explanation of the purpose, how it would improve, and how the idea would work.

### Skills
#### Communication
During the expo and the in-class presentation it was important to thoroughly explain what each section was since no one but me really experienced my website fully. Having people's thoughts and feedback made me known of what people focused on and could be glossed over.
#### Growth Mindset
Having many people coming and going made me change what started and ended my pitch given to the people. The first few times was me giving importance to the different hardwares in farming and many people were left confused on the rest so going forward I gave attention to that less and less and focused more on the bootstrap, generalized the information of software and hardware and made the intentions clear of what the Aframe was meant to do what my goal was in creating and picking this topic and choosing these certain softwares and hardwares was.
