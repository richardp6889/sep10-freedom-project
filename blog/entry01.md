## Agriculture 
#### I choose this topic since the concept of turning water into something that can be eaten and help you survive is something that has fasinated me and has led me to ask the question of where now? if we are in a comfortable space then were will agriculutre evolve to go. Farming has evovled from simply having people manually water plants and tend to the crops frequently to having big machinery worry about water, quality control, collecting and packaging to ship to stores. A place like [National geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/impact-technology-agriculture/) has already had some ideas of what might be next 
## Transportation 
#### Transportation was the next in line to be choosen over agriclututre since it is confusing to see what we will get from frequent car inovvations that are almost every year if not more. What will we get after cars that are self-driving exist? A company like [builtin](https://builtin.com/transportation-tech) shows the history of transportation and what we can expect to see in the near future. 
## Delivery services 
#### I choose this topic becuase as a person who orders online the fastest way to get what I buy to me would be the people that deliver it and I would like to help or see how the process can be made quicker and in a timely manner. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fedex-express/2021/11/22/technology-is-powering-new-modes-of-delivery-for-an-on-demand-economy/?sh=169f07306783) forsees that the rapid conversion of people that shop online will demand more and effective delivery. SInce more people are ordering this would not be a bad idea since it would promote the stability and trust we put into shipping services like FedEx, Amazon, UPS, USPS, etc. 

#### The problem for agriculture seems to be the fact that it is such a labor focused job and required constant maintenance to be effective and the people that work the fields are often time that not tired and exhausted after having such a tiring day. It is believed that the next step taken towards hands free farming is autonomous tractors and harvesting machine and machine that place seeds and remove weeds. Something I believe could work is grow plants that produce a lot of produce that could then make the machine needed to make it automatic without having to worry about other neighboring plants. A prototype would be selectively breeding many cucumbers to produce one that sprouts a lot of them that would then be used to gogrow more and spread this gene. 

* This has shown me that there are many people thinking the same as me since one google search would show millions of result but adding more words like current and pending shows more recent examples that are being made.
