## Topic  
#### I choose this topic since the concept of turning water into something that can be eaten and help you survive is something that has fasinated me and has led me to ask the question of where now? if we are in a comfortable space then were will agriculutre evolve to go. Farming has evovled from simply having people manually water plants and tend to the crops frequently to having big machinery worry about water, quality control, collecting and packaging to ship to stores. A place like [National geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/impact-technology-agriculture/) has already had some ideas of what might be next. Other topic in mind would have been Delivery services and transportation. 
##EDP 
#### The current problem in automative problem is people in the big farming industry are unwilling to dip their feet into new forms of farming that have a chance to ruin their profits but if it works it would be better overall for everyone since the machinery would still need supervision incase of a malfunction. If this was the only one it would be doable but it isnÂ´t becasue another problem is the cost and work it would cost people. Since this process will take people jobs and some might pose against the idea of automated farming to keep their work. Cost would be something else to take into consideration since building a fully automated machine from scratch would be a difficult procedure. 

## Skills 
This has shown me that there are many people with the same idea in mind to automate farming and there seems to be progress. With this in mind, finding useful and plentiful information was easy. 

This also allows for more information to be atained in a shorter time meaning if better information or changes need to be made it will be done.
