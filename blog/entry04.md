### Tool
I deciced to pick aframe since it could be used to make a 3D model that can be used to project my idea on how the invention should look like. It also allows for a better yield since the other tools offer other ways of using CSS and I believe that aframe offers a different touch on a website.
### Tinkering 
Based on the image below you can see how I made a sphere, cylinder and cube while making the sky blue. This was made through information on the aframe website and a video with a basic explanation on what the position, rotation, and color can be changed.

Organization: Figuring out a way to get to pick and decide on a tool and having a space in the notes and a file to test them out involve a certain level of organization since if you aren't you are lost in the information and that would confuse one even more.

How to Read: Making progress in this was accomplished by reading the aframe and understanding the video involve different things since although both are code and that code explained they are both different in the sense that understanding it yourself or being taught by someone else will be taken differently.
