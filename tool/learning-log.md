# Tool Learning Log

Something I tried was learning the position values which in my understanding is (x y z) cordinates from where you statt which is (0 0 0) and by change one you change how high to the right, left, foward, or back it goes. Along with this I also tried using shapes that were the basic ones such as a ring with animation and a pane that is a square.

A trouble I ran into was making the shapes join and instead focused on where it would be rather than how it would be and focues on it more the next time I tinker with it.

Something I will try next is:
* Joining the shapes together
* figure out how much space one item takes up
* If it is possible to shrink elements

What I did this week was learn the spacing needed to stack or put them horizontally which is about 1.4-.5 for stacking spheres and the cubes can stack on a 1 per cube. I learned this through tinkering with the shapes and changing only one of tha values to see which one is the optimal for having them together but not going into each other or leave a gap of space.

The only trouble I ran on doing this was finding out what spot the point of view is on since it is not aligned with the cube on one above the ground.

Something I will try next is:
The next thing is will try is using these shapes to make something out of many of them.
Also using more shapes than just the cubes and spheres.

Something that I worked on this week was purely making shapes out of these blocks. No really anythin else but making a stack or cubes and spheres and other thing of of these elements.

Next time I will learn other shapes and try to make a scene instead of just objects in the void.

I made a ground by using the box as a ground and strechin it out and cubes as object above it and adding a sky. Something I learned was that the box can be streched out.

Something I struggled with was goign below zero

Something to try next time will be making it move by animation

I made a scene with a big box as a ground that start at where the view is and will "tress" made of a streched up cube and cylinders as "leafs" it was poorly made since it looks like a too round stack on top of the "trunk".

Something I will struggle with is the x y and z since it is to the right for the x and up for the y and z goes in the dierection that the "viewer" is and to make it go in the opposite dierection it make it go the reverse way.

Animation is still on my mind and is something I will work on. As of now the only thing I have done is watch a few videos for animation.

Something I did this week was using the animation on a set of objects that move in a circular motion
