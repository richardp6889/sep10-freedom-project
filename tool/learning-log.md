Something I tried was learning the position values which in my understanding is (x y z) cordinates from where you statt which is (0 0 0) and by change one you change how high to the right, left, foward, or back it goes. Along with this I also tried using shapes that were the basic ones such as a ring with animation and a pane that is a square.

A trouble I ran into was making the shapes join and instead focused on where it would be rather than how it would be and focues on it more the next time I tinker with it.

Something I will try next is:
* Joining the shapes together
* figure out how much space one item takes up
* If it is possible to shrink elements

1.4-.5 is optimal for stacking
