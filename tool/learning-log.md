Something I tried was learning the position values which in my understanding is (x y z) cordinates from where you statt which is (0 0 0) and by change one you change how high to the right, left, foward, or back it goes. Along with this I also tried using shapes that were the basic ones such as a ring with animation and a pane that is a square.

A trouble I ran into was making the shapes join and instead focused on where it would be rather than how it would be and focues on it more the next time I tinker with it.

Something I will try next is:
* Joining the shapes together
* figure out how much space one item takes up
* If it is possible to shrink elements

What I did this week was learn the spacing needed to stack or put them horizontally which is about 1.4-.5 for stacking spheres and the cubes can stack on a 1 per cube. I learned this through tinkering with the shapes and changing only one of tha values to see which one is the optimal for having them together but not going into each other or leave a gap of space.

The only trouble I ran on doing this was finding out what spot the point of view is on since it is not aligned with the cube on one above the ground.

Something I will try next is:
The next thing is will try is using these shapes to make something out of many of them.
Also using more shapes than just the cubes and spheres.

Something that I worked on this week was purely making shapes out of these blocks. No really anythin else but making a stack or cubes and spheres and other thing of of these elements.
